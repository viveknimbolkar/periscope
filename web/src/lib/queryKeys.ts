// queryKeys — single source of truth for every React Query key in the
// app. Replaces the prior pattern of inline string-literal keys
// scattered across hooks and mutation call sites, which let small
// drift (e.g. plural/singular mismatches) silently break invalidation.
//
// Shape: hierarchical tuples that nest the cluster id, the resource
// kind, and the view (list / detail / yaml / events / meta / metrics).
// Each branch exposes an `all` prefix so a mutation can invalidate the
// whole subtree in one call:
//
//     qc.invalidateQueries({
//       queryKey: queryKeys.cluster(c).kind("deployments").all,
//     });
//
// cascades to the deployments list, every loaded deployment detail,
// yaml, events, meta, and metrics for that cluster.
//
// Two top-level subtrees plus two registry siblings:
//   ['cluster', c, ...]   — every per-cluster query.
//   ['edit', ...]         — editor dirty-bit pub/sub. Sibling of
//                            ['cluster', ...] so resource invalidation
//                            cannot blow away the editor's dirty
//                            indicator.
//   ['clusters']          — the cluster registry (list of clusters);
//                            sibling, not nested under ['cluster', c],
//                            because it is not data inside a cluster.
//
// Adding a new query? Add the factory here, then call it from the
// hook. Static check (run before merge):
//
//     grep -RnE 'queryKey:\s*\[' web/src --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx'
//
// Only this file should match.
