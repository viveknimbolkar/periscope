// Package audit defines the event shape and emission pipeline for
// Periscope's audit trail.
//
// Every privileged action — pod exec, secret reveal, resource
// apply/delete, cronjob trigger — is recorded as a single
// audit.Event flowed through an Emitter. The Emitter fans out to
// one or more Sinks (today: stdout JSON; future: SQLite, external).
//
// Why a dedicated package: prior to this refactor the same logical
// event was emitted as ad-hoc slog calls at each handler with three
// different field shapes, with no audit row at all on the failure
// path. Pinning a single shape here lets every handler emit the same
// way, lets a downstream sink rely on stable field names, and gives
// us one place to add future cross-cutting concerns (signing,
// shipping to a SIEM, redaction).
//
// Stdlib-only by design — the audit pipeline must not pull in heavy
// dependencies because every privileged code path runs through it.

// Verb classifies what the actor did. The set is closed: a new verb
// should be added explicitly here rather than passed as a free string,
// so downstream queries (and the future SQLite schema) can index on
// it.
//
// Note that VerbApply covers create-and-update through Server-Side
// Apply — Periscope's mutation surface (PATCH with
// application/apply-patch+yaml) does not split create vs update at
// the API level, and we don't synthesize the distinction client-side.
// The forensic question "did this row create or modify the
// resource?" is answerable by joining audit rows: the first
// successful apply for a given (cluster, ns, group, version,
// resource, name) is the create; everything after is an update.
