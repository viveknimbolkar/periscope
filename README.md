**v1.0.0 launched.** Read the [launch announcement](https://github.com/gnana997/periscope/discussions/70) — origin story, what shipped, what's not in v1.0, and what's next.

> **Status — v1.0 stable.** Public HTTP API, configuration shape, and Helm values are covered by semver: breaking changes will land in a future major (v2). Bugfixes and additive features land on minor / patch tags off `main`. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what shipped per release.

## What is Periscope

Periscope is a self-hosted, multi-cluster Kubernetes console focused on EKS environments where modern compliance regimes make static AWS credentials hard to justify. It authenticates **to** clusters using Pod Identity / IRSA, authenticates **users** via OIDC, and writes a structured audit trail signed by the human who took each action — all from a stateless, single-binary deployment.

## Why Periscope

- **No long-lived AWS keys.** Cluster access is obtained on demand via Pod Identity or IRSA. Nothing static lives on the console pod.
- **Real human in every audit row.** Every K8s call carries the user's OIDC identity via impersonation, so the audit log shows `alice@corp` — never `periscope-bot`.
- **OIDC-gated user identity.** Auth0 and Okta tested. Authorization by IdP group, with configurable tiers.
- **Searchable audit log.** SQLite-backed, with a first-class in-app view, time-filterable and retention-bounded — compliance reviews stop being a log-grep exercise.
- **Live, not polled.** 21+ resource list pages stream over SSE for real-time updates, with a tested polling fallback for restrictive proxies.
- **Schema-aware YAML editor.** Built-in kinds and Custom Resources. Server-side apply, field-ownership glyphs, conflict resolution, live drift detection while editing.

## Quickstart

### Run locally

Prerequisites: Go 1.26, Node 22, and a kubeconfig with access to at least one cluster.

```sh
make backend    # Go API on :8088
make frontend   # Vite dev server on :5173 (proxies /api -> :8088)
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

### Install on a cluster

A Helm chart lives at [`deploy/helm/periscope/`](deploy/helm/periscope/). Full walkthrough including OIDC client setup and Pod Identity / IRSA wiring: [`docs/setup/deploy.md`](docs/setup/deploy.md).


```sh
# Pin to a specific version. Find the latest at
# https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/periscope/periscope
helm install periscope \
  oci://ghcr.io/gnana997/charts/periscope \
  --version <VERSION> \
  --namespace periscope --create-namespace
```

For CI / scripts that always want the latest stable, resolve the tag from the GitHub API:

```sh
LATEST=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/gnana997/periscope/releases/latest \
  | jq -r .tag_name | sed 's/^v//')
helm install periscope \
  oci://ghcr.io/gnana997/charts/periscope \
  --version "$LATEST" \
  --namespace periscope --create-namespace
```

Both signed (cosign keyless) and discoverable on [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/periscope/periscope). To verify the chart signature before install, see the verification snippet in [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Features

**Authentication & access**
- Pod Identity / IRSA for cluster access (no static AWS credentials on the pod)
- OIDC user auth with IdP-group-gated authorization (shared / tier / raw modes)
- Per-cluster RBAC enforced server-side via `Impersonate-User` / `Impersonate-Group` headers
- Pre-flight RBAC checks (SAR / SSRR) so disabled buttons explain why instead of failing on click

**Multi-cluster**
- Fleet view at `/` — every registered cluster as a status card with identity, hot signals, and one-click drill-in
- Switch context from the cluster rail (Slack-style left bar)
- Per-cluster scoping for every resource view
- Add managed clusters via `backend: agent` (#42) — `kubectl apply` an agent on any K8s with outbound HTTPS, no IAM trust required. Works on EKS, GKE, AKS, on-prem k3s.

**Browsing & inspection**
- Common resources (pods, deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, jobs, ingresses, RBAC, …) plus full Custom Resource catalog
- Live events, describe view, logs (with follow + filtering)
- In-browser pod shell (`exec`) with reconnect on transient disconnects — works on every backend (eks, kubeconfig, in-cluster, agent)
- Cmd+K palette: search resources by name across the active cluster

**Real-time updates (watch streams)**
- 21+ resource list pages stream over SSE for live updates spanning workloads, networking, storage, and cluster-scoped resources
- Per-user concurrency cap to keep apiserver watch quotas safe
- Polling fallback when the EventSource path fails (corporate proxies, etc.)
- Operator opt-out via Helm: subset, group aliases (`workloads`, `networking`, `storage`, `cluster`, `core`), or full disable

**Editing**
- Inline Monaco YAML editor for any resource — built-in or CRD
- Schema-aware autocomplete and validation against the cluster's `/openapi/v3`
- Server-side apply with minimal diffs (no `last-applied` annotation churn)
- Field-ownership glyphs: see who manages each field before you edit
- Conflict resolution: per-field "keep mine / take theirs" when a controller owns the field
- Live drift detection: warns when the cluster changes underneath the editor
- Unsaved-changes guards on refresh, sidebar nav, row-click

**Helm**
- Read-only Helm release browser per cluster (no Helm SDK dep — direct Secret/ConfigMap decoding)
- Per-release values, manifest, history, and structured dyff-based diff between revisions
- Auto-probes Secret vs ConfigMap storage drivers per cluster

**Audit & observability**
- Every privileged action signed by the human user — apply, delete, exec, secret reveal, log open, cronjob trigger
- Persistent audit log: SQLite (single-replica), with retention and size caps
- First-class in-app audit view with filters by actor, verb, outcome, time range, namespace, request id
- Density timeline strip surfaces denials and failures at a glance
- Tier-mode audit-admin groups can see every actor's rows; everyone else sees their own
- Structured JSON events also stream to stdout for shipping into CloudWatch / Loki / OpenSearch / Datadog

## Configuration

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| OIDC (user auth) | [`examples/config/auth.yaml.auth0`](examples/config/auth.yaml.auth0), [`examples/config/auth.yaml.okta`](examples/config/auth.yaml.okta) |
| Cluster registry | Helm values; see [deploy guide](docs/setup/deploy.md) |
| In-cluster RBAC | [`docs/setup/cluster-rbac.md`](docs/setup/cluster-rbac.md) |
| Audit persistence | Helm `audit:` block; see [`docs/setup/audit.md`](docs/setup/audit.md) |
| Watch streams | Helm `watchStreams:` block; see [`docs/setup/watch-streams.md`](docs/setup/watch-streams.md) |

## Architecture

Single Go binary embeds the React SPA. Stateless with respect to user credentials — OIDC sessions kept in memory only; no kubeconfigs or AWS keys persisted. Runs as non-root with a read-only root filesystem, no privilege escalation, and a `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile (configured in the Helm chart).

For component-level detail see [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) and [`docs/rfcs/`](docs/rfcs/).

## Development

Repository layout:

```
cmd/periscope/    backend entry point
internal/         backend packages (auth, authz, audit, clusters, credentials, exec, k8s, secrets, sse, httpx, spa)
web/              React + TypeScript SPA (Vite, Monaco editor)
deploy/helm/      Helm chart
docs/             setup guides, architecture notes, RFCs
examples/         reference configs
Makefile          common targets
```

Common targets:

| Target | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `make backend` | Run the Go backend on `:8088` |
| `make frontend` | Run the Vite dev server on `:5173` |
| `make build` | Build the SPA, embed it, produce a single binary at `bin/periscope` |
| `make test` | Run Go tests |
| `make image` | Build the container image |
| `make helm-lint` / `make helm-template` | Validate or render the chart locally |

Frontend tests:

```sh
cd web && npx vitest run
```

CI: every push and PR runs `golangci-lint`, `go test`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `helm lint` + `helm template` smoke renders, and an embedded-binary build. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml).

## Roadmap

Planning is tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gnana997/periscope/issues). Notable post-v1.0 items: expanded write paths in the Helm release browser (rollback / upgrade) and richer per-cluster RBAC introspection.
